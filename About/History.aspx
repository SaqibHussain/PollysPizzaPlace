            A dream becomes a reality in 1991, with the birth of Polly's Pizza Place. During
            this period to this date the company has expanded rapidly with over 95 branches.
            We have been one of the UK's leading take-away and delivery companies and introduced
            the concept of FREE DELIVERY!
            <br />
            <br />
            Polly's Pizza Place is a pizza delivery service. We’re not a fast food joint (we
            deliver good, fresh food fast), we’re not a takeaway (on average, only 30% of our
            pizzas are collected) and we’re not a restaurant (our stores don’t have eat-in facilities).
            Polly's Pizza exists to fulfil a basic need for our customers - to provide a high
            quality, freshly prepared, hot meal delivered on time, every time. And if you consider
            that each of our pizzas is made to order from fine and fresh ingredients, you can
            see why they call us “the pizza delivery experts”.
